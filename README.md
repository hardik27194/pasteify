### Important note

Please note that while you have the right to browse, contribute, and modify my code, you do not have the right to publish it to the App Store without making significant changes. If you feel like you have made a significant fork of this application and wish to publish it, please notify me that you wish to do so lest I mistakenly ask Apple to remove it from the store.
